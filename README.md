For this assignment I was tasked to create a simple weather display using the "Open Weather API".

This assignment was a great learning opportunity to use an API, and to use it as the main subject for the HTML page. 

It was nice being able to fully practice this ability as it is very important in the web dev field. 

Although API documentation can be quite terrifying especially the very ugly ones, but luckily the "Open Weather API" has very clear and concise documentation. 

One thing I would say as a critique to my application is the design isnt as professional as I'd like it to be.

I am definetely more of a problem solving/building developer more than I am a Visual artist. However, I need to improve my styling skills using script.
